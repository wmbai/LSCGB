# Large-Scale CG images Benchmark (NLPR-LSCGB):

We build a Large-Scale CG images Benchmark (NLPR-LSCGB), which is orders of magnitude bigger than existing datasets. The strict collection principles guarantee a high diversity and small bias in dataset.

## Examples

#### Computer-Generated (CG) images
